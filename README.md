# ROLL THE BLOCK (OR BLOCKCHAIN)

Blockchains are immutable, sequential chain of records called Blocks. They can contain transactions, files or any data you like, really. But the important thing is that theyâ€™re chained together using hashes.

[Architecture is based on Bancolombia Scaffold](https://github.com/bancolombia/scaffold-clean-architecture) but some liberties were taken

## GettingStarted ðŸš€

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on
your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment
for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

* Java 11
* IntelliJ is highly recommended

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development
env running

1. Clone repo
2. Open with IntelliJ 
3. Run the project
4. Import the Postman Collection
5. Run '1 Mine'

And you will get

```

    "data": {
        "content": {
            "message": "New Block Forged",
            "index": 2,
